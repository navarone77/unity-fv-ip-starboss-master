### Unity Starboss Tutorial Project re-uploaded.

Since the project link seems to be down for a while now, I have uploaded this repo which is the example project from Procedural Animated Boss

This project was obtained from the original link but through waybackmachine, which can also be found here

There are a couple of deprecated apis which aren't as easy to port, mainly the **RenderTargetHandle**
so with that said, the original version of this project is Unity 2019.

Hopefully someone else will find use in this until unity has a newer  / fixed version.
